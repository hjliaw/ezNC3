** remove .pio, re-compile OK
** copy ezNC sources  OK!  runs w/o wifi client GEE
        had to modify oled library to add new font
        had to add encoder library
        added encoder & buttons, still ok
** foo_bar state preserved, X-file
* DONE need to debounce main switch  MAY need more
* TODO drill and peck drill
* TODO enlarge hole
* TODO circlar cut ? inner or outer, if peripheral or clear-cut 
* TODO inner-edge & outer-edge cuts (jig ?)
* TODO encoder to speed up or slow down a cut
* DONE save user config to a file or EEPROM
        tool_dia, jog_speed, run_speed, ui encoder direction, screen flip
* DONE goto position with jog speed or run speed ? run, safer

** set single float number 
** goto or set position XY, Z

* ui menu is not very responsive
* need a way to clear errors upon boot up
  door or limit switch error may be tripped
