* can not get my_fnc to work, try starting with FluidNC (already slightly modified) 
** remove .pio, re-compile OK
** copy ezNC sources  OK!  runs w/o wifi client GEE
        had to modify oled library to add new font
        had to add encoder library
        added encoder & buttons, still ok
** foo_bar state preserved
* DONE need to debounce main switch  MAY need more
* DONE "mark" one or two positions, then "pwr feed"
        dy != 0, repeat N (zig-zag, used for surfaceing or pocket)
        dz  < 0, repeat N (deeper z on each travel), Q: one-way or two-way cuts ? 
* TODO drill and peck drill
* TODO enlarge hole
* Q: learn and repeat ?
* TODO circlar cut ? inner or outer, if peripheral or clear-cut 
* TODO inner-edge & outer-edge cuts (jig ?)
* TODO encoder to speed up or slow down a cut
* DONE save user config to a file or EEPROM
        tool_dia, jog_speed, run_speed, ui encoder direction, screen flip
* Q: goto position with jog speed or run speed ? run, safer

* NOTE: two cases where touchR is not cancel
** set single float number 
** goto or set position XY, Z

* ui menu is not very responsive
* need a way to clear errors upon boot up
  door or limit switch error may be tripped
