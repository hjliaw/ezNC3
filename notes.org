* can not get my_fnc to work, try starting with FluidNC (already slightly modified) 
** remove .pio, re-compile OK
** copy ezNC sources  OK!  runs w/o wifi client GEE
        had to modify oled library to add new font
		cp fonts/*  .pio/libdeps/ezTinybee/ESP8266\ and\ ESP32\ OLED\ driver\ for\ SSD1306\ displays/src/.
        had to add encoder library
        added encoder & buttons, still ok
** foo_bar state preserved, X-file
* DONE need to debounce main switch  MAY need more
* TODO drill and peck drill
* TODO enlarge hole
* TODO circlar cut ? inner or outer, if peripheral or clear-cut 
* TODO inner-edge & outer-edge cuts (jig ?)
* TODO encoder to speed up or slow down a cut
* DONE save user config to a file or EEPROM
        tool_dia, jog_speed, run_speed, ui encoder direction, screen flip
* DONE goto position with jog speed or run speed ? run, safer
* NOTE: two cases where touchR is not cancel
** set single float number 
** goto or set position XY, Z

* ui menu is not very responsive
* need a way to clear errors upon boot up
  door or limit switch error may be tripped

* BUGS
** GONE ? cancel gcode doesn't update dro
** sometimes, power up in hold, door, ... ?

* DONE auto init littlefs doens't work ?
        had to use '$localfs/format=littlefs' to format
        and manually copy files over, needs improvement
** ans: use esptool to copy existing partition
** notes: use config.yaml instead of tinybee.yaml, considering enlarge file system ?
** fixed: file system mismatch, fixed by copy the whole partition
*** dev module panick'd ? tinybee is ok
        error is caused by littlefs,
        ./components/esp_littlefs/src/littlefs/lfs.c:1071:error: Corrupted dir pair at {0x0, 0x1}
*** load eznc, run grbl to format fs, then it is ok ?
        repeatable with flash erased, need grbl to format file system
* DONE new partition (some Tinybee may have 8MB)
  binary file size (fnc @ 20230325)
